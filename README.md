# Lifting State Up
## Replacement of classes by function/hook on reactjs.org lifting docs/sample 

original sample can be found on:
[React Docs] (https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html#gatsby-focus-wrapper) using functions and hooks instead of the use of Classes.

This small project is a `translation` of the class aproach of code (used on documentation) to the functional aproach, as its's the tendence of coding and people get used to this way; 
It comes to turn example more easy to undestand.  

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
